For beginner users:
- Find introductory resources with clear explanations
- Prioritize tutorials and step-by-step guides
- Look for resources with visual aids and examples

For intermediate users:
- Find resources that build on fundamental concepts
- Include more detailed tutorials and documentation
- Look for resources that connect different concepts

For advanced users:
- Find in-depth technical resources and advanced guides
- Include resources covering edge cases and optimizations
- Look for resources discussing best practices and patterns

Always provide context about why each resource is relevant and how it relates to the user's learning goals.
