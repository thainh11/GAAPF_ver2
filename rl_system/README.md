## Quick Start

### Installation

```python
# The RL system is included as part of the GAAPF project

```

### Basic Usage

```python

# Create configuration
config = RLConfig(
    enabled=True,
    mode=RLSystemMode.FULL,
    algorithm=RLAlgorithm.AUTO,
    base_path="./rl_data"
)

# Initialize and start RL system
async def main():
    rl_system = RLSystem(config)
    await rl_system.start()
    
    # Get RL-enhanced constellation manager
    constellation_manager = rl_system.get_constellation_manager()
    
    # Use for agent team formation
    team = await constellation_manager.form_constellation(
        task_description="Complex data analysis task",
        required_capabilities=["data_analysis", "visualization", "reporting"],
        max_agents=3
    )
    
    # Stop system when done
    await rl_system.stop()

# Run the system
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Configuration Options

```python
from rl_system import RLConfig, RLSystemMode, RLAlgorithm

config = RLConfig(
    # General settings
    enabled=True,
    mode=RLSystemMode.FULL,  # DISABLED, TRAINING, INFERENCE, EVALUATION, TESTING, FULL
